        <h2>First Lady of Space</h2>
        <p>Before humans were launched into space, many animals were propelled heavenwards to pave the way for mankind's pioneering endeavors. These original pioneers, including numerous monkeys, served their nations in order to investigate the biological effects of space travel.
            Perhaps the most famous animal astronaut is Laika, the Soviet space dog who made her historic flight on November 3, 1957. The United States preferred to use monkeys for its missions and launched numerous monkey flights primarily between 1948 and 1961 paving the way for manned missions.
            Thirty-two monkeys flew in the space program; each had only one mission. Numerous back-up monkeys also went through the programs but never flew. Monkeys from several species were used, including rhesus monkeys, cynomolgus monkeys, and squirrel monkeys, as well as pig-tailed macaques.</p>
 
        <h2>Miss Baker's Historic Flight</h2>  
        <p>Miss Baker and fellow female pioneer Able's historic flight on May 28, 1959 proved a turning point in the US space era. The first beings ever to be recovered alive from a flight into outer space, their journey paved the way for putting the first man into orbit around the earth.</p>
